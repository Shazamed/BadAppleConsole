This program plays bad apple on the console

1. Ensure you have downloaded a mp4 of bad apple and rename it "bad_apple.mp4"
2. Run frame_converter to extract the individual frames into ./frames
3. Run bad_apple.py

Note: the printing speed of the frames is not at 30fps. The sleep function does not provide a high enough precision to adjust the delay between each frame.
